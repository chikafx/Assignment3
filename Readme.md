# This project demonstrates how to create a set of loading spinners using HTML and CSS animations. The spinners  are implemented using div containers, each assigned a specific class to define their unique animations and styles.

# Structure
# The HTML structure is simple, with each spinner being a div element with a specific class. The CSS file, 
# located in the css folder, contains the styles and animations for these spinners.
